# detecting_dyslexia
this tool is an open source tool for detecting dyslexia based on EEG

According to survey by Indian pediatrics organization. In India 12-18% of total learning disabilities are identified as Dyslexia, 14 % comes under Dysgraphia and 5.5% of Dyscalculia.Dyslexia is characterized by an unexpected difficulty in speaking and reading in children. In some cases the dyslexic children are often mistakenly assumed to be “outgrown”.

By range of investiagtion, it is well proven fact that if dyslexia is early detected in children then it can be cured by neurofeedback[Lubar's model].But current practice across the world is looking for some symptoms which is errorneous in nature. Therefore, our objective is to develop a tool for detecting dyslexia in children based on it's brain waves.
